# Python-Advanced---Soft-University
The Python Advanced course builds on Python language skills by addressing more complex language-specific concepts (such as modules and comprehension). 
In the course you will learn to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with stacks
and queues (Stacks &amp; Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples &amp; Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists), files and directories. 
Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. You will take a closer look at lamba functions, recursive functions, and multi-argument functions.
The development environment that will be used by the training team is PyCharm, but each student is free to use tools of their choice.
